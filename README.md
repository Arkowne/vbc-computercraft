# üéûÔ∏è Video to .blt Converter for ComputerCraft

This project converts standard video files into frame-by-frame `.blt` images and DFPWM audio, fully compatible with the [ComputerCraft](https://tweaked.cc/) mod in Minecraft.

Each video is processed and split into individual frames, resized and exported in the `.blt` format using a custom NFP (Notchian Frame Protocol) rendering style. The audio is also extracted and encoded in `dfpwm` format, which is supported by in-game audio players like `speaker.playDFPWM`.
